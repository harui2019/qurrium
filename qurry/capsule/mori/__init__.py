Mori üíÄ (:mod:`qurry.capsule.mori`)
================================================================

## Why Mori?

    There are many dedicated data structures for Qurry üçõ 
    If we say one of them like a tree in forest, 
    then all data structures combine, 
    it makes a forest or 'Ê£Æ' read as mori in Japanese. 
    Definitely NOT because I'm a DeadBeat, 
    the fan of Hololive VTuber Mori Calliope, 
    and I didn't want to name something after her for a not short time.
