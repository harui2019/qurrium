![Available System](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-10_|_11-purple?logo=Windows&logoColor=white) ![Available System](https://img.shields.io/badge/MacOS-11+-purple?logo=Apple&logoColor=white)

- **Ubuntu 18.04+ LTS (All ManyLinux 2014 compatible distro)**
  - on `x86_64` **(recommended)**
  - on `x86_64` Windows 10/11 WSL2 **(recommended)**
  - on `aarch64`
  - We strongly recommend to use Linux based system, due to Python multiprocessing may exist some unknown issue on Windows and the GPU acceleration of `Qiskit`, `qiskit-aer-gpu` only works with Nvidia CUDA on Linux.
- **Windows 10/11**
  - on `x86_64`
- **MacOS 11+**
  - on `aarch64 (Apple Silicon, M1/M2/M3 chips)` **(recommended)**
  - on `x86_64 (Intel chips)`

- with required modules:
  - `qiskit`, `qiskit-aer`, `tqdm`, `requests`
- with optional modules:
  - `qiskit-aer-gpu`: when use Linux
  - `qiskit-ibm-provider`: when use IBM Quantum
  - `qiskit-ibmq-provider`: when use IBM Quantum, the deprecated version of `qiskit-ibm-provider`

## Install

### By PyPI

Not available now, but coming soon

### By TestPyPI

```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer tqdm requests 
# the installation from testPyPI can' t find these dependencies
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ qurry
```

### Maually by Git

**This method is installed from source**, since we introduce Rust, **it will require "Rust complier" you need to install first.**

You can install rust quickly by the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then, you can install `qurry` by the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harui2019/qurry.git --recursive
cd qurry
pip install -e .
```

We have pytest for testing, you can run the following command to test:

```bash
pytest
```

After you finish the installation and want to comfirm the installation.
