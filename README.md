## Install

### By PyPI - Stable Release

- Would show up in `pip list` as `qurrium-x.y.z`
- This may not be the latest version and update frequently, but it's stable.

```bash
pip install qurrium
```

### By TestPyPI - Nightly Release

- Would show up in `pip list` as `qurry-x.y.z.devW`
- This will include some new features and bug fixes, but it may not be stable.

```bash
pip install qiskit tqdm requests
# the installation from testPyPI can' t find these dependencies
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ qurry
```

### Maually by Git

**This method is installed from source**, since we use Cython and Rust, **it will require "C complier" and "Rust complier" which you need to install them first.**

You can install rust quickly by the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then, you can install `qurry` by the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harui2019/qurry-preview.git --recursive
cd qurry
pip install -e .
```

#### Test Installation

We use `pytest` for testing, you can run the following command to test:

```bash
pytest
```

After you finish the installation and want to comfirm the installation.

## Environment

**We currently <ins>SUPPORT qiskit 0.46.0+ and qiskit 1.0.0+</ins>, other lower version is no longer available.**

- **Ubuntu 18.04+ LTS (All ManyLinux 2014 compatible distro)**
  - on `x86_64` **(recommended)**
  - on `x86_64` Windows 10/11 WSL2 **(recommended)**
  - on `aarch64`
  - We strongly recommend to use Linux based system, due to Python multiprocessing may exist some unknown issue on Windows and the GPU acceleration of `Qiskit`, `qiskit-aer-gpu` only works with Nvidia CUDA on Linux.
- **Windows 10/11**
  - on `x86_64`
- **MacOS 11+**

  - on `aarch64 (Apple Silicon, M1/M2/M3/M4 chips)`
  - on `x86_64 (Intel chips)`

- with required modules:
  - [`qiskit`](https://pypi.org/project/qiskit/), [`tqdm`](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/), [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- with optional modules:
  - `qiskit-aer`: The complete simulator package of `qiskit`
  - `qiskit-aer-gpu`: The gpu acceleration of `qiskit-aer` when use Linux and Nvidia GPU
    - `qiskit-aer-gpu-cu11`: Extra package for CUDA 11
  - `qiskit-ibm-runtime`: When use IBM Quantum Device
  - `qiskit-ibm-provider`: When use IBM Quantum Device, but it will be deprecated soon.
  - `qiskit-ibmq-provider`: When use IBM Quantum Device, which has been deprecated.
