# Qurry üçõ - The Quantum Experiment Manager for Qiskit and The Measuring Tool for Renyi Entropy, Wave Function Overlap, and More

This is a tool to measure the Renyi entropy, Loschmidt Echo, and Magnetization Squared of given wave function. Running on **IBM Qiskit** with the function from constructing experiment object to pending the jobs to IBMQ automatically.

## Environment

![Available Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9_|_3.10_|_3.11-blue?logo=python&logoColor=white)
![Available System](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-18.04+-purple?logo=Ubuntu&logoColor=white) ![Available System](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu_on_Windows_WSL-18.04+-purple?logo=Ubuntu&logoColor=white)

 <!-- ![Available System](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-10_|_11-purple?logo=Windows&logoColor=white) -->

- **Recommended `Python 3.9.7+` installed by Anaconda**

  - on

    - **Ubuntu 18.04+ LTS** on `x86_64` **(recommended)**
    - **Ubuntu 18.04+ LTS on Windows 10/11 WSL2** on `x86_64` **(recommended)**
      - We strongly recommend to use Linux based system, due to the paralell calculation function only works on Unix-like currently and the GPU acceleration of `Qiskit`, `qiskit-aer-gpu` only works with Nvidia CUDA on Linux.
    - ~~**Windows 10/11** on `x86_64`~~
      - currently with issues on `multiprocessing` module on Windows.
    - **MacOS 12+** on **`arm64 (Apple Silicon, M1 chips)`**
    - **MacOS 12+** on **`x86_64 (Intel chips)`**
      - Maybe some unknown python issues exist.

  - with required modules:

    - `qiskit`

  - with optional modules:
    - `qiskit-aer-gpu`: when use Linux

## Install

### Maually by Git

**This method is installed from source**, since we introduce Rust, **it will require "Rust complier" you need to install first.**

You can install rust quickly by the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then, you can install `qurry` by the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harui2019/qurry.git --recursive
cd qurry
pip install -e .
```

We have pytest for testing, you can run the following command to test:

```bash
pytest
```

After you finish the installation and want to comfirm the installation.

### By PyPI

Not available now, but coming soon
