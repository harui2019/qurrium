    "Cython acceleration that has been implemented will remain in the package, but not be updated anymore. For the computation efficiency of Cython is only slightly better than that of Python. Nonetheless, Cython and Python are hard to work parallelly due to not just **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) in multi-thread**, but also **memory-wasted and inefficient for each children process in multi-process**. Therefore, we decided to focus on Rust acceleration. Python version will be remained for the compatibility and the convenience of debugging."
