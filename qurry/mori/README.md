# Mori 🌳 🍛 - Qurry Data Structure Complex

- *A side product of Qurry 🍛 - The Measuring Tool for Renyi Entropy, Loschmidt Echo, and Magnetization Squared, The Library of Some Common Cases*

This is a package which indepents from the data structure of Qurry 🍛 for easier version control and not designed for general use like Gajima 🔄 🍛, the progress bar module also divided from Qurry 🍛.

**This module is far from finish and will update frenquently with the development of Qurry 🍛 .**

## Why this name ?

There are many dedicated data structures for Qurry 🍛 If we say one of them like a tree in forest, then all data structures combine, it makes a forest or '森' mori in Japanese.
Definitely NOT because I'm a DeadBeat, the fan of Hololive VTuber Mori Calliope, and I didn't want to name something after her for a not short time.
