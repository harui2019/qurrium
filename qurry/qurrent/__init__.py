Qurrent - Second Renyi Entropy Measurement
Qurshady - Classical Shadow with Second Renyi Entropy
(:mod:`qurry.qurrent`)
================================================================

.. tip::
    1.  The name "qurrent" was the second proposed name for this package.
        Itâ€™s not simply "current" with a "q" replacing the "c", 
        but rather a combination of "qurr" and "ent", where "ent" abbreviates "entropy", 
        and "qurr" is a coined prefix beginning with "qu" to imply "quantum".

    2.  The initial proposed name for the package was "xproc", short for "experimental process".

    3.  Another module, "qurrech", combines "qurr" with "ech", 
        where "ech" is short for "echo", 
        the Loschmidt echo being a key concept in quantum information theory.
        This inspired us to adopt "qurry", derived from "qurr" and the suffix "ry", 
        to resemble words like "query" or "curry".

    4.  Since a package named "qurry" already exists on PyPI, 
        and many projects on GitHub also use this name, 
        we changed the suffix from "y" to "ium", creating "qurrium".
        "Qurrium" is unique and easily searchable, 
        with no prior use on PyPI or in general web searches.

    5.  So there is the evolution of the package name: 
        `xproc -> qurrent -> qurry -> qurrium`
